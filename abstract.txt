Falls are one of the leading causes of death and unintentional injuries worldwide. Adults
over the age of 65 and individuals in care facilities tend to suffer more falls. Activity recognition using camera data has been significantly researched. However, they
raise privacy concerns for subjects. Wearable sensors are another alternative, including pendants and smartwatches. However, this approach will require the individualâ€™s
responsibility.

In this thesis, I will set out to develop a deep learning anomaly-based fall detection
approach that uses mmWave radar sensors to monitor individuals and create a back-end
system to collect data from the sensors and detect falls in real-time.
