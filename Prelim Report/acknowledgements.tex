\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

The work from this topic has been heavily inspired by my wonderful supervisor Dr. Reza Argha. I would like to personally thank Reza for providing me with this topic, support and feedback along the way, and someone who would guide me down the right path, especially for the deep-learning section. The mentorship and support received was invaluable.  

I would also like to thank my assessor, Dr. Nigel Lovell, for providing critical feedback and guidance along the way. Furthermore, I would also like to thank Dr. Michael Stevens for his constant support; he has provided many valuable insights into the topic and created a fantastic atmosphere for weekly meetings. Lastly, I would like to thank Ariyamehr Rezaei; he had helped me set up the code base and showed me how to access and use the data required for the model.
